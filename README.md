# Customer-Churn-Prediction-In-Financial-Instituitions
People now have a wide range of options for where to save their money thanks to the emergence of numerous banks and smaller financial institutions throughout the years. As a result, banks are now giving customers better options for saving money or obtaining loans for major purchases. This project's primary goal is to better understand banks by using data from banks that include information on bank customers and a target variable of whether or not the customer has left the bank and suggest the changes to the financial institutions. The implementation of the same would be done using the tool R and by applying various Machine Learning Algorithms throughout the process like Logistic, Classification Tree, XGBoost, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes and SVM.
